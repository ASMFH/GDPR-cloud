# GDPR-cloud
In this project, we explore EU legislation and also foreign laws to identify the different impacts on the cloud computing ecosystem. This was accomplished by carrying out a thorough systematic literature review on the following topics: cloud architecture, legislation like GDPR, Standard Contractual Clause
(SCC), EU-US Privacy Shield, CLOUD Act
and relevant protection techniques for cloud.
We also look through many discrete recent
cases where cloud solutions had challenges to
comply with legislation. We decided to select the Chromebook-gate case where privacy
of a Danish school children was compromised.
Along with this case, we also selected four relevant cases of big tech companies like Microsoft,
Facebook, TikTok, and Google Analytics. We
have performed an analytical case study of
all these cases and examined the core issues
that led these cases to contradict with EU legislation. We have also performed two interviews with current experts of the field to have
a better understanding of the whole scenario.
Then, we propose a model named Data Confinement Framework and validate if the framework is able to address all those issues of the
cases providing solutions. With our analysis,
we have showed that our framework is effective and functional to solve all the mentioned
cases.
